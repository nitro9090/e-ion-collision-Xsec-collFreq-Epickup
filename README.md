# e-ion-collision-Xsec-collFreq-Epickup

This code calculates the electron and ion collision cross-sections, collision frequencies and energy pickup 
for particles accelerated in an electric field at atmospheric pressure.   The data is plotted as electron temperature vs. 
x-sec/coll freq/energy pickup for various electron densities and looks at whether the particles will preferentially 
collide with electrons, ions or neutral particles.

The input values can be edited for different plasma densities and energies
